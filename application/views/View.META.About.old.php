			<div class="section WHAT">
								
				<span class="title">OK you've said that, but what is it, really?</span>
				
				<p class="indent left" style="width:50%;">well, really, this is our take on how a platform dedicated to photography geeks or passionate photographers should be.</p>
				<p class="indent left" style="width:40%;">you can upload your photos, create groups and indulge in community discussions.</p>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				
			</div>
			
			<div class="section HOW">
								
				<span class="title">That's pretty generic; how do you say this platform is dedicated to photography enthusiasts?</span>
				
				<div class="emphasis left" style="width:37%;border-right:1px solid #1a1a1a;">
					<span class="supertitle" style="margin-bottom:10px;">photographers love feedback.</span>
					<div class="screenshot shot_review left"></div>			
					<div class="subtext left" style="width:120px;">
						<p>on creya, you can submit your photos to the community for review.</p>
						<p>we've worked on some interesting tools to help the community provide you with some useful feedback.</p>
						<p>visit the community section to view examples.</p>

						<span class="supertitle">photographers hate clutter around their photos.</span>
						<div class="subtext">
							<p>we've kept everything in creya at a bare minimum, be it features, user interface or adverts. we want all the focus to be on your work.</p>

						<span class="supertitle">photographers love a neat gallery.</span>
						<div class="subtext">
							<p>further to being minimalistic and neat, your gallery can be filtered (searched) not just by tags/names or genre, but also by EXIF data. we've tried to make this feature as intuitive as possible. it fits in seamlessly with your gallery.  </p>

			<div class="section WHY_NOT">
								
				<span class="title">Hey, but you don't provide photo sets??</span>
				
				<p class="indent left" style="width:50%;">well, we don't. but we do provide shoeboxes.<BR><BR>by now, you're used to creating filters for your emails instead of folders. we've extended the same concept for photographs. instead of creating static ‘Sets’ in which you would need to manually add photos, we encourage you to create Shoeboxes. Shoeboxes are dynamic sets created by a set of filters.</p>
				<p class="indent left" style="width:45%;">for example, let's say you filtered your gallery for all photos that are in the medium telephoto range, let's say<BR>[focal=50mm-130mm] AND [ISO =400], you could now save this filter set as a shoebox.<BR><BR>So the next time you upload photos, any photo that fits that criteria automatically makes its way into the shoebox.</p>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				
				<div class="screenshot shoebox_creation" style="margin-top:25px;"></div>				
				
			</div>
			
			<div class="section COST">
								
				<span class="title">How many photos can i upload?</span>
				
				<p class="indent left" style="width:55%;">as long as we're in beta, we only provide the standard account.<BR>the account is free but is limited to <strong>150 photograph uploads</strong> and <strong>5 shoeboxes.</strong></p>
				<p class="indent left" style="width:40%;">we're working on adding more accounts post beta. its too soon to tell.</p>
				<div class="clear"></div>
				
			</div>
			
			<div class="section WHY_INVITE_ONLY">
								
				<span class="title">OK maybe i'll join, but why the 'invite only’ policy?</span>
				
				<p class="indent left" style="width:97%;">the creya community wants to make sure that every member is passionate about photography. this is important to maintain a high standard of community involvement.</p>
				<!--p class="indent left" style="width:45%;">we're making sure that everyone in this community shares your passion so that you can benefit from it.</p-->
